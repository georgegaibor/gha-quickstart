# Quickstart for GitHub Actions

## Introduction

`Github Actions` is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate:
* builds
* tests
* deployment pipelines

## Creating your first workflow

* Workflow files must be created in a directory called `./github/workflows`.
* Workflow files can have any name and should use `.yml` or `.yaml` as file name extension.
